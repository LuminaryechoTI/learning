Object Literals in JavaScript

What is an Object Literal?

An object literal is a way to create an object in JavaScript using a concise syntax. It is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string and each value can be any type of data, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and even functions.

Creating an Object Literal

You can create an object literal using the following syntax:

let myObject = {
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
 ...
};
For example:

let person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Software Engineer'
};
Properties

In an object literal, each key-value pair is called a property. You can access a property using the dot notation:

console.log(person.name); // Output: John Doe
Methods

You can also add methods to an object literal using function expressions:

let person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Software Engineer',
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello, my name is ' this.name);
  }
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John Doe
Computed Property Names

In ES6 and later, you can use computed property names to create dynamic property names:

let dynamicKey = 'foo';
let myObject = {
  [dynamicKey]: 'bar'
};

console.log(myObject); // Output: { foo: "bar" }
Shorthand Properties

In ES6 and later, you can use shorthand properties to create properties with the same name as a variable:

let name = 'John Doe';
let age = 30;

let person = { name, age };

console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John Doe", age: 30 }
Method Shorthand

In ES6 and later, you can use method shorthand to create methods with a concise syntax:

let person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log('Hello, my name is ' this.name);
  }
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John Doe
Object Literal Extensions

In ES2022 and later, you can use object literal extensions to add new properties to an existing object:

let person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30
};

person = {
 ...person,
  occupation: 'Software Engineer'
};

console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John Doe", age: 30, occupation: "Software Engineer" }
